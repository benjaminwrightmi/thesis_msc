\begin{itemize}
\item Tested and implemented TAR jet lepton-disentanglement algorithm. (Track-Assisted-Reclustered [TAR] jets are defined in subsection \ref{subsection:TARjets}, and lepton-disentanglement is described in subsection \ref{subsection:disent}.)
\item Developed and tested selection criteria for the ``merged" signal region. (The ``merged" signal region optimization is described in subsection \ref{subsection:sr_opt}.)
\item Developed and tested merged and resolved \ttbar control region selection criteria. (The \ttbar control regions are described in Section \ref{section:CRtt}.)
\item Created data-MC comparisons for $W$+jets and \ttbar control regions (shown in Appendix \ref{section:datamc}).
\item Developed and implemented single-muon OR \met trigger strategy (described in Section \ref{section:trig}).
\item Worked on production of samples (ntuples) used by the analysis.
\item Worked on implementation of HistFitter package for exclusion fits.
\item Contributed to internal documentation for full Run-2 analysis paper.
\item Co-developed and maintained plotting repository used for analysis plots.
\end{itemize}
