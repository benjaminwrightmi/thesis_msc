This thesis presents the design of the most sensitive ``merged" signal region, as well as two control regions to constrain the \ttbar background, in the search for the theorized dark sector process $s\rightarrow WW\rightarrow q\bar{q}\ell\nu$. In this process, dark matter is produced as a new heavy vector boson, $Z'$, together with a scalar ``dark Higgs" boson, $s$, that decays to a pair of $W$ bosons with a semileptonic final state. In this model, a new Higgs mechanism associated with $s$ generates the masses of the dark sector particles, and the mixing of $s$ with the Standard Model Higgs boson allows it to decay to Standard Model particles and be observable over a large range of model parameter space at the Large Hadron Collider. This search uses 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.
Using the designed signal and control regions, in this search we will be able to exclude $Z^\prime$ masses up to a range between approximately 1200 to 2200 GeV, and $s$ masses from approximately 150 GeV up to a range between approximately 290 to 360 GeV.
