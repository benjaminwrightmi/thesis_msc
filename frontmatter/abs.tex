This thesis presents the design of the most sensitive ``merged" signal region, as well as two control regions to constrain the \ttbar background, in the search for the theorized dark sector process $s~\rightarrow~WW~\rightarrow~q\bar{q}\ell\nu$. In this process, dark matter is produced with a new heavy vector boson, $Z'$, and a scalar ``dark Higgs" boson, $s$, decaying to a pair of $W$ bosons with a semileptonic final state.

Signal region events are characterized by

A new technique is used to
